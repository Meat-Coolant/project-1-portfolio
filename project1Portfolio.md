## Project Description

This is my first project and I'll be making my ideal website that will portray who I am, what I've done and how to contact me. My website will all be done with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery. I will be basing my website off cool and simple websites like [Shadow Arena](https://shadowarena.pearlabyss.com/) and [WoW](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/). The formatting for both their mobile and PC is great.
